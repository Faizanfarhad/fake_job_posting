# 🛡️ Spot the Scam - Fake Job Detection using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Overview

Online job platforms are increasingly targeted by scammers. These fake job listings not only waste applicants’ time but also put their personal data and finances at risk.

**Spot the Scam** is a machine learning-powered project that detects fraudulent job postings **before** users apply.

### 🎯 Features:
- **Trained binary classifier** (Real vs Fake jobs)
- **Preprocessing & feature extraction pipeline**
- **Interactive dashboard** built with **Streamlit**
- **Insightful visualizations** to explore scam patterns

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Manual detection of fake job listings is slow and unreliable. This project aims to **automate scam detection** using machine learning trained on real-world job listing data.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 📂 **CSV Upload**: Accepts job listings with `title`, `description`, etc.
- ✅ **Prediction**: Classifies each job as Real (0) or Fake (1) with a confidence score
- 📊 **Visual Insights**:
  - Histogram of fraud probabilities
  - Pie chart of real vs fake jobs
  - Table of predictions
  - Top 10 most suspicious listings

> **Model**: Logistic Regression trained on cleaned dataset

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Joblib
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
